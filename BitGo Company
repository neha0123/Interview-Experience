Round 1: Online Assesment
Round 2: DSA
Part 1:



- Given an m x n 2D binary grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.



  - You may choose how to receive the grid input, along with any additional input's that may seem useful



- An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically (not diagionally). You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.



- The following is an example test case, and represents 5 islands



const test_case_1_1 = {

	input: [

		[1,0,0,1],

		[0,1,1,0],

		[1,0,0,1],

	],

	output: 5

} 



- The following is an example test case, and represents 1 island



const test_case_1_2 = {

	input: [

		[1,0,1,1],

		[1,0,0,1],

		[1,1,1,1],

	],

	output: 1

} 



You are allowed to change or modify the input.

/**

Part 2:



(This question is a continuation of the previous question and it's solution)



- Let's now remove the assumption that all edges of the grid are surrounded by water, and that the grid now "wraps" around both horizontally and vertically.



- The following is an example test case, and represents 1 island



const test_case_2_1 = {

	input: [

		[1,0,0,1],

		[0,0,0,1],

		[1,0,0,1],

	],

	output: 1,

}



- The following is an example test case, and represents 2 island



const test_case_2_2 = {

	input: [

		[1,0,0,1],

		[0,1,1,0],

		[0,0,0,1],

	],

	output: 2,

}





You are allowed to change or modify the input.

What would you change about your solution if you needed to process a grid so large it would not fit into memory?
